# Library Management System

>  A Simple easy to use library management system REST API build using Spring Boot and Secured by Spring Security allows users to perform various operations related to books and customers

## Features
Using this API an user will be able to :

- Add books to the library by providing details such as the title, author, and publication year.
Update the details of a book, such as its title or author, by providing the book's ID.
- Remove a book from the library by providing its ID.
- Add customers to the system by providing their personal details such as name, address, and phone number.
- Update the personal details of a customer, such as their name or address, by providing the customer's ID.
- Remove a customer from the system by providing their ID.
- Assign a book to a customer by providing the book's ID and the customer's ID.
- Search for books by keyword.
- Secure the API with Spring security, allowing only admins to access all operations after providing login details.
- The API allows users to perform these operations via HTTP requests, such as POST, PUT, and DELETE. The API returns appropriate responses, such as success or error messages, in the form of JSON data.

## User Instructions

### NOTE
> If you have trouble configuring the security parameters with a tool like Postman, you can comment out the spring-boot-starter-security and spring-security-test dependencies in the pom.xml file and dont't forget to comment out the ```com/anudip/lms/authentication/AdminDetails.java``` file to avoid errors.
> **Boom** ðŸ”¥ Now you can call Api's via postman or similar tools without any authentaction :)
